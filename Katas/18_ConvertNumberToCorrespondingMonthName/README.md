## Description
Convert Number to Corresponding Month Name
Create a function that takes a number (from 1 to 12) and returns its corresponding month name as a string. For example, if you're given 3 as input, your function should return "March", because March is the 3rd month.

Number	Month Name
1	    January
2	    February
3	    March
4	    April
5	    May
6	    June
7	    July
8	    August
9	    September
10	    October
11	    November
12	    December
Examples
MonthName(3) ➞ "March"
MonthName(12) ➞ "December"
