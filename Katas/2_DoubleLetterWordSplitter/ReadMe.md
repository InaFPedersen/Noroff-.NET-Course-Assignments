Double letter Word splitter

## Description
Double letter Word splitter
Write a function called splitOnDoubleLetter() that receives a word, of type string, as an argument. The function should split the word where any double letter is found and return an array of the split word. If no repeated letters are found, simply return an empty array


Examples:
splitOnDoubleLetter(‘Letter’) -> [‘let’, ‘ter’]

splitOnDoubleLetter(‘Really’) -> [‘real’, ‘ly’]

splitOnDoubleLetter(‘Happy’) -> [‘hap’, ‘py’]

splitOnDoubleLetter(‘Shall’) -> [‘shal’, ‘l’]

splitOnDoubleLetter(‘Tool’) -> [‘to’, ‘ol’]

splitOnDoubleLetter(‘Mississippi’) -> [‘Mis’, ‘sis’, ‘sip’, ‘pi’]

splitOnDoubleLetter(‘Easy) returns []
