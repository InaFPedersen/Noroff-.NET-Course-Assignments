## Description
Tic Tac Toe
Given a 3x3 matrix of a completed tic-tac-toe game, create a function that returns whether the game is a win for "X", "O", or a "Draw", where "X" and "O" represent themselves on the matrix, and "E" represents an empty spot.

Examples
ticTacToe([
  ["X", "O", "X"],
  ["O", "X",  "O"],
  ["O", "X",  "X"]

]) ➞ "X"

ticTacToe([
  ["O", "O", "O"],
  ["O", "X", "X"],
  ["E", "X", "X"]

]) ➞ "O"

ticTacToe([
  ["X", "X", "O"],
  ["O", "O", "X"],
  ["X", "X", "O"]

]) ➞ "Draw"

Notes
Make sure that if O wins, you return the letter "O" and not the integer 0 (zero) and if it's a draw, make sure you return the capitalised word "Draw". If you return "X" or "O", make sure they're capitalised too.
