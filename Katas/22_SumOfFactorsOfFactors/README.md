## Description
Sum of Factors of Factors
Create a method that takes a number and returns the sum of factors of factors of the given number.
Examples
SumFF(69) ➞ 3, 23 ➞ 0
// Both 3 and 23 are prime numbers and have no factors
// other than 1 and themselves so the result is 0.

SumFF(12) ➞ 2, 3, 4, 6 ➞ (0) + (0) + (2) + (2+3) ➞ 7

SumFF(420) ➞ 2,4, 6, 10, 12 ... ➞ (2) + (2+3) + (2+5) + (2+3+4+6) ... ➞ 1175

SumFF(619) ➞ ___ ➞ 0
// 619 doesn't have any factors (other than 1 and 619).
Notes
The number will always be greater than 0.
Factors that are equal to the number or 1, don't count (see example #1).
